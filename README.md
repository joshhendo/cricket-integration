\*\* Cricket Integration \*\*

This is a very basic, console based C\# application which will fetch cricket
scores from the Cricinfo API, and post milestones to a slack channel.

 

It’s got a long way to come, but it works for basic scores and events.

 

\*\*\* Notes \*\*\*

\* Ensure to update the App.config file with the appropriate details (teams you
want to follow and your Slack Incoming Webhook URL).

\* You also need to ensure that the director C:\\Temp exists, as a database is
stored there for basic information.
